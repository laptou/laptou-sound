## color palette
- use the **stone** palette for backgrounds (warm grays) instead of slate
- layer translucent backgrounds with opacity, e.g. `bg-stone-900/50`, `hover:bg-stone-900/80`
- use vibrant violet/indigo/purple gradients for accent overlays
- radial gradient overlays with masks add depth: `bg-linear-to-br from-violet-500 via-indigo-500 to-purple-500 mask-radial-at-top mask-circle`

## text hierarchy
- use **opacity** for muted text instead of specific gray colors (easier theming)
- primary text: full opacity
- secondary/bylines: `opacity-70`
- tertiary/timestamps: `opacity-50`

## borders & corners
- avoid explicit borders where possible; use background contrast instead
- for list items (track cards), use **flat edges** (no rounded corners) for a clean edge-to-edge look
- for standalone panels, modals, and inputs, use gentle corner radii (`rounded-lg`, `rounded-xl`)

## depth & effects
- use `backdrop-blur-sm` on translucent overlays
- use drop shadows sparingly for elevated interactive elements

## feedback
- use the toaster (`ui/sonner`) to provide feedback when an action has completed
