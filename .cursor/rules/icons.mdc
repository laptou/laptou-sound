For icons, use `lucide-solid`.

Lucide is built with ES Modules, so it's completely tree-shakable.

Each icon can be imported as a Solid component, which renders an inline SVG element. This way, only the icons that are imported into your project are included in the final bundle. The rest of the icons are tree-shaken away.
Example

Additional props can be passed to adjust the icon:

```jsx
import { Camera } from 'lucide-solid';

// Usage
const App = () => {
  return <Camera color="red" size={48} />;
};

export default App;
```

Vite loading/performing issues with the dev server can be resolved by import icons directly from the lucide-solid/icons directory:

```jsx
import Camera from 'lucide-solid/icons/camera';

// Usage
const App = () => {
  return <Camera color="red" size={48} />;
};

export default App;
```

So you should always import them this way.
