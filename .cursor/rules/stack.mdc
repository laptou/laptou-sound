The stack for this project:
- TanStack Start is our full-stack framework
- Biome is our linter

On the server side:
- Use Better Auth (https://www.better-auth.com/llms.txt) for all authentication/authorization-related tasks
- Use Drizzle ORM (see `llm-docs/drizzle.txt`) for interfacing with the database
- Use Cloudflare D1 (see `llm-docs/cf/d1.txt`) as the database
- Use Cloudflare R2 (see `llm-docs/cf/r2.txt`) as the object storage
- Use Cloudflare Queues (see `llm-docs/cf/queues.txt`) as the message queue / job queue 

On the client side:
- Use Tailwind v4 for all client side styling
- Use SolidJS for all client-side components

If you don't know how something works, refer to the documentation so you can implement it properly instead of guessing. I have downloaded a lot of the relevant documentation into the `llm-docs` folder.
