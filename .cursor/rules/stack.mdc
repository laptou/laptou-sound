The stack for this project:
- TanStack Start is our full-stack framework
- Biome is our linter
- Bun is our package manager

On the server side:
- Use Better Auth (https://www.better-auth.com/llms.txt) for all authentication/authorization-related tasks
- Use Drizzle ORM (see `llm-docs/drizzle.txt`) for interfacing with the database
- Use Cloudflare D1 (see `llm-docs/cf/d1.txt`) as the database
- Use Cloudflare R2 (see `llm-docs/cf/r2.txt`) as the object storage
- Use Cloudflare Queues (see `llm-docs/cf/queues.txt`) as the message queue / job queue 

On the client side:
- Use Tailwind v4 for all client side styling
- Use SolidJS for all client-side components
- For common components, use Solid-UI
  - Solid-UI doesn't natively support Tailwind v4 yet, so we can install new Solid-UI components using `shadcn`'s CLI for now: `bunx shadcn@beta add @solid-ui/text-field`
- Use TanStack Form (`@tanstack/solid-form`) for form state management
- Use TanStack Query mutations for API calls that modify data
- Use reusable form components from `@/components/FormField` (FormField, FormTextArea, FormCheckbox, FormCheckboxSimple)
- Use `@/components/FileUploadZone` for file upload UI

If you don't know how something works, refer to the documentation so you can implement it properly instead of guessing. I have downloaded a lot of the relevant documentation into the `llm-docs` folder.

If you need to modify `wrangler.jsonc`, prefer to do so using `bun wrangler` commands instead of modifying it directly.

Make sure to check the contents of the `llm-docs` folder so that you know which docs are available.

In SolidJS, when using the `<Show>` component, take advantage of the fact that it can take a lambda as a child to reduce code verbosity / reduce the number of null checks required.

Avoid using default exports when writing components if you can help it.
